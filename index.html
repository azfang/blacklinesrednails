            There is something unmistakably beautiful to be found in conversations between the intangible.
            Ink bleeding through pages, leaving accidental imprints on the other end. Spoken words being picked up 
            and tossed away by the wind. 
            <br>
            <br>
            In unexpected dialogues between language and image, typography concretizes and holds the fleeting concepts of the image. The power in
            stylized words in influencing photography is manifold. Meaning can be added, subtracted, with too
            much or too little pared back and stripped away:
            “Language and image, each trespassing in the other’s house, secrete disquieting 
            disjunctions, conundrums, circularities. We are accustomed to the poetic strategy, within language, of 
            bracketing a noun within the genus of yet another noun [...] Translation of that strategy 
            into the economy of images yields artifacts…. savagely grotesque, arch, silly.”<sup>1</sup> These
            words, written by Hollis Frampton, speak of the attribution of meaning 
            and its impact—possibly damaging, potentially misappropriating—on photography.

            artifacts graphic designers may yield when we use language as our basis for photographic analysis.
            This project, which works with the avant-garde body and its translation into typographic representation, 
            is a direct challenge to denigrators of photographic interpretation. Working with images, 
            a good designer doesn’t tamper, nor do they strip away context. Perhaps with
